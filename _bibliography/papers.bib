  abstract = {Over the past 30 years, there has been a surge of interest in understanding the experiences and outcomes of expectant and parenting foster youth. Despite the importance of understanding this unique population of foster youth, there remains a lack of research on fathers in foster care. Most studies of expectant and parenting foster youth focus on mothers in care, and studies that have examined fathers in care provide little insight compared to what we know about mothers. Furthermore, existing research on fathers in foster care is limited by underreporting, service engagement issues, lack of meaningful engagement data, and very little information on fathers’ involvement with their children. There is very little published research on the experience of fatherhood in foster care or on related outcomes for fathers in care such as residency with children, father engagement with children, coparental relationship quality, or the health and well-being of their children. While there have been over 60 studies and three reviews on expectant and parenting foster youth spanning roughly 30 years, the articles have primarily focused on empirical findings relating to mothers in foster care. Information on fathers in foster care has received little attention and is restricted to empirical studies. This scoping review aims to fill this gap by examining the available information on fathers in foster care. To this end, our scoping review explores empirical findings and knowledge from practice-, legal-, and policy-related literature related to fathers in foster care from peer-reviewed journal articles, reports, dissertations, white papers, and grey literature published between 1989 and 2021. Findings from 94 sources of evidence on expectant and parenting foster youth suggest that mothers in foster care are consistently the focus of the literature. If fathers in foster care are included in the literature, findings or guidance are often provided in the aggregate (e.g., parents in care). However, when aggregated, literature still focuses on mothers in care, or female pronouns are used to describe the larger expectant or parenting foster youth population. Many of the studies excluded fathers, and the primary exclusion rationale includes a lack of identified fathers in care, unreliable child welfare data on fathers, or high attrition of fathers in parenting services. In terms of information on fathers in foster care by the source of evidence, research papers often provided quantitative descriptions of fathers, practice papers focused on rights of fathers, legal papers centered on paternity establishment or paternal rights, and policy papers largely discussed the need for improved data tracking and interventions for fathers. More research is needed to support fathers in foster care as they transition out of care into early adulthood and young fatherhood.},

  abstract = {The Social Work, White Supremacy, and Racial Justice (SWWSRJ) symposium aimed to confront and address racism within the social work profession. As recent events, such as the shootings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, have forced America to reckon with its history of White supremacy, racism, and colonialism, the symposium sought to guide the future of social work towards confronting these issues. So, where do we go from here? To advance social work, six actions must be taken: learning from the past; acknowledging past atrocities against BIPOC communities; addressing Whiteness, racism, and colonialism concurrently; creating meaningful reform or engaging in abolition; teaching an inclusive social work history; and re-engaging historical research methods. By focusing on these six areas, social work can dismantle White supremacy, racism, and colonialization, and work towards a future that supports and uplifts BIPOC communities. The success of this effort depends on individual commitment to change and the willingness to listen and learn from diverse voices within the profession’s past. As we move forward, it is crucial to recognize the importance of this symposium and the potential for meaningful change. By actively engaging with the lessons presented and taking concrete action, social work can contribute to a more just and equitable society, ensuring that the ripple of change generated from the symposium extends far into the future. Ultimately, the answer to the question “where do we go from here?” lies within each participant’s dedication to implementing the knowledge and insights gained from the SWWSRJ symposium.},

	url = {https://appam.confex.com/appam/2022/meetingapp.cgi/Session/16910},
	abstract = {In the United States, approximately 4.8 million young people between the ages of 16 and 24 are neither employed nor in school. These young people are often referred to as “disconnected youth” or “opportunity youth.” The process of disconnection and reconnection from education and employment is complex, influenced by diverse and interconnected structural, system, community, familial, and individual factors. Relatedly, diverse research disciplines, study methods, public policies, and interventions exist to identify and address the ways youth connect to education and employment. The papers on this panel will describe four distinct approaches to synthesizing what is known about youth disconnection and reconnection and explore how to apply the findings to advance policy, interventions, and future policy research. The projects and their associated papers describe unique approaches and distinct methods to integrating knowledge across a wide range of disciplines including education, labor, developmental psychology, family and child policy, justice policy, and poverty and income policy, among other fields.
The first paper lays the groundwork for the panel by describing findings from an evidence gap map that systematically summarizes the available research about programs in the United States and the practices used to support young people who experience disconnection from school and work during their transition to adulthood. The findings from the evidence gap map show that most programs incorporate comprehensive approaches that integrate knowledge across a range of fields to address disconnection. The second paper will explore disconnection from a wider lens, presenting findings from simulations of public policies and large public programs aimed at improving the ways young people may move on an upward or downward path of economic mobility. The findings provide a sense of how various policy interventions including, for example, education and criminology, might benefit youth and identify strategies and interventions that policymakers and the public may view as worthy of further investment. The third paper stays focused on data analytics, zooming in on findings about the development of a casework tool that one comprehensive program for young people who experience the child welfare and justice system is using to tailor education, employment, housing, and social support services to suit each youth’s circumstances. The tool uses participant and program data and quasi-experimental analytic techniques to generate individualized and interactive developmental, behavioral, educational, and employment service recommendations and milestones for each participant. The final paper re-focuses on young peoples’ voices and uses participatory action research to explore the ways young people who experience homelessness describe their employment experiences and perspectives on their careers. The findings highlight a broad range of opportunities – through both practice and policy approaches – to further support youth facing homelessness on their journeys toward self-sufficiency.

Taken together, the panel will reinforce the central theme that an interdisciplinary approach – both in terms of methods applied and how multiple disciplines intersect to influence how young people disconnect and reconnect - strengthens understanding and creates new opportunities for problem solving and innovation.},

	url = {https://appam.confex.com/appam/2022/meetingapp.cgi/Session/16892},
	abstract = {More policy attention has been paid to how effective human service programs are than to how equitably those programs are implemented. Although previous research provides suggestive evidence on ways in which program operations and treatment can induce disparities for socioeconomically marginalized groups, especially racial and ethnic minorities, it is not yet conclusive. This panel consists of four presentations that explicitly focus on whether and how racial and ethnic disparities arise in human services programs. All papers look at racial disparities resulting from low-income families’ involvement in overlapping systems, including the criminal legal system, child welfare, and family court.
The first paper, “Overlapping Systems: Race and Ethnic Disparities in Parental Rights Termination Following Incarceration,” looks at the nexus between the criminal justice system and child welfare system involvement, both of which are common among families with racial and ethnic minority backgrounds. The paper examines the association between incarceration and loss of parental rights, whether the link varies across racialized groups, and, if it varies, why. The second paper, “The Legal Circuitry of Inequality: A Legal Census of Child Support Enforcement in California Law,” extends the connection of criminal justice policy to child support. The paper discusses the legal capacity of child support enforcement and its proximity to monetary sanctions as legal punishments that are disparate across racialized groups. The third paper, “Driver’s License Suspensions, Social Compliance, and the Reproduction of Racial Inequality,” brings a broader perspective to explore geographic variability in the use of drivers’ license suspensions. The paper investigates whether and how punishment for “social noncompliance” ironically creates additional structural barriers to compliance, especially for racially and ethnically marginalized communities. The final paper, “Understanding Racial Disparities in Child Support Arrears,” focuses on structural issues in the child support system. The paper describes racial and ethnic disparities both in mechanisms in the setting of the order through which noncustodial parents are penalized and in the link between these mechanisms and noncompliance that can lead to consequential penalties. All papers employ unique and rich data from administrative records to legislative code. The papers also leverage multiple research methods, from quantitative analyses of individual-level and zip-code level data and (qualitative) legal analysis. The chair, presenters and discussants reflect diversity across lines of race/ethnicity, gender, region, affiliation, and discipline. The panel’s chair and discussants are experts in practice and scholarship who have been particularly dedicated to the topic of racial and ethnic justice. The panel contributes to addressing fundamental issues pervasive in human services programs and opens up the opportunity to engage the audience in this timely and imperative discussion.},

	abstract = {Over the past 30 years, there has been a surge of interest in understanding the experiences and outcomes of expectant and parenting foster youth. Despite the importance of understanding this unique population of foster youth, there remains a lack of research on fathers in foster care. Most studies of expectant and parenting foster youth focus on mothers in care, and studies that have examined fathers in care provide little insight compared to what we know about mothers. Furthermore, existing research on fathers in foster care is limited by underreporting, service engagement issues, lack of meaningful engagement data, and very little information on fathers’ involvement with their children. There is very little published research on the experience of fatherhood in foster care or on related outcomes for fathers in care such as residency with children, father engagement with children, coparental relationship quality, or the health and well-being of their children. While there have been over 60 studies and three reviews on expectant and parenting foster youth spanning roughly 30 years, the articles have primarily focused on empirical findings relating to mothers in foster care. Information on fathers in foster care has received little attention and is restricted to empirical studies. This scoping review aims to fill this gap by examining the available information on fathers in foster care. To this end, our scoping review explores empirical findings and knowledge from practice-, legal-, and policy-related literature related to fathers in foster care from peer-reviewed journal articles, reports, dissertations, white papers, and grey literature published between 1989 and 2021. Findings from 94 sources of evidence on expectant and parenting foster youth suggest that mothers in foster care are consistently the focus of the literature. If fathers in foster care are included in the literature, findings or guidance are often provided in the aggregate (e.g., parents in care). However, when aggregated, literature still focuses on mothers in care, or female pronouns are used to describe the larger expectant or parenting foster youth population. Many of the studies excluded fathers, and the primary exclusion rationale includes a lack of identified fathers in care, unreliable child welfare data on fathers, or high attrition of fathers in parenting services. In terms of information on fathers in foster care by the source of evidence, research papers often provided quantitative descriptions of fathers, practice papers focused on rights of fathers, legal papers centered on paternity establishment or paternal rights, and policy papers largely discussed the need for improved data tracking and interventions for fathers. More research is needed to support fathers in foster care as they transition out of care into early adulthood and young fatherhood.},

	volume = {78},
	doi = {10.1037/amp0001120},
	abstract = {Much of the early psychological research on Black fathers and families employed a deficit lens, pathologizing Black fathers as absent and uninvolved contributors to their children’s development. As a response, several Black psychologists articulated the need to move away from deficit-based approaches and employ strengths-based and adaptive frameworks to examine the social experiences of Black fathers and their contributions to child development. This transformative work was not only central to advancing research on Black fathers but also a cornerstone in the broader fathering literature. Though the list of foundational architects of Black fatherhood scholarship spans disciplines, we center this article around the contributions of eight Black psychologists—Drs. Phillip Bowman, Cleopatra Howard Caldwell, Anderson J. Franklin, Nancy Boyd-Franklin, Vivian Gadsden, Harriette Pipes McAdoo, John L. McAdoo, and Melvin Wilson. Their collective works and scientific contributions provided a critical lens and articulated a vision for research on Black fathers. In highlighting their contributions, we focus on six thematic areas: (a) conceptual and theoretical advancements, (b) research methods and designs that centered Black fathers, (c) description and contextualization, (d) children’s development and well-being, (e) theory to practice and intervention, and (f) scientific cross-pollination and collaborative ethos. Last, we review and highlight research branches and extensions of these foundational roots.},

Previous studies have examined youth- and policy-level factors’ influence on EFC participation and human capital outcomes (e.g., education, employment). Still, few studies have examined contextual factors (e.g., county characteristics). We explore how local contexts, or county-level attributes, influence youths’ EFC participation and human capital outcomes (i.e., postsecondary education enrollment and earnings). We analyze two datasets from California Youth Transitions to Adulthood Study: survey data with rich youth-level information ( n = 529) and state child welfare administrative data with a larger sample size ( n = 2392). After controlling for a wide range of youth characteristics and adjusting between-county variations, regression results find that several county characteristics predict youths’ EFC participation and human capital outcomes at age 21, such as political atmosphere and worker’s satisfaction with cross-system collaboration. We conclude with a discussion of implications for research and practice.},

	shorttitle = {Doctoral students’ academic and professional network development},

	doi = {10.28945/4869},
	abstract = {Aim/Purpose: The overarching purpose of this paper was to examine how a collaborative working group of doctoral students from different institutions evolved into a community of practice and developmental network. Specifically, the aim of this study was to examine this group’s progression from working group to support group, a process that occurred through academic support, social support, professional networking, professional development, and skill development.

Background: Although doctoral cohorts are often formed within the same school, some informal groups may develop among students in the same discipline from different schools. The authors explored how the formation of a working group, through attendance at an annual academic conference, enhanced their doctoral education and expanded their network through social and academic support. 

Methodology: The participant-researchers in this study used collaborative autoethnography to collectively examine their participation in this group formed outside of their respective schools of social work. Having worked together for over a year, meeting monthly through video calls, on a discrete project, the participant-researchers embarked on this collaborative authoethnography as they discovered their transformation from working group to support group. This group of five participant-researchers examined their own feelings about their participation in the group and the consequent benefits of belonging to such a group.

Contribution: This study makes an important contribution to the doctoral education literature about how doctoral students from different schools can form informal groups that serve as a key source of intra-disciplinary networking, resources, opportunities, and support. This contribution helps to further the research on what kinds of supports doctoral students need in order to remain in their programs and graduate.

Findings: We found that a working group of doctoral students from different schools of social work can develop into a community that can be used for social, academic, and networking support. We discovered that relationships with peers across schools provided a supportive environment that was distinct from those formed within our schools. Joining together to achieve a common research goal encouraged members to extend content-specific support. In addition, this group found that members had the opportunity to compare experiences at their respective doctoral programs, which enhanced peer support.

Recommendations for Practitioners: Special interest groups at national conferences should encourage doctoral students at different schools to form communities of practice or similar groups. This group formation may lead to opportunities for doctoral students to work on a common project (e.g., website, publication) and serve as a source of social and academic support.

Recommendation for Researchers: More research is needed on whether this relationship among doctoral students within the same discipline at different schools is equally helpful among students in different disciplines. Additional research is also needed on whether communities formed during doctoral studies can promote future collaboration as students become professors or researchers.

Impact on Society: The present study’s model is applicable for use in academic settings where doctoral students convene for conferences relating to research, teaching, and practice. This model can facilitate the formation of inter-university working groups among students with similar research interests, career trajectories, and life responsibilities. Such groups can enrich peer support, promote collaboration, and enhance professional development.

Future Research: More research is needed on whether this kind of social support group amongst doctoral students can be sustained as the students transition into academic careers. Additional research is also needed on whether these types of informal groups work across research focus or whether it works best when students have the same research focus.},

Thousands of ordinary people were ostracized, facing material consequences including imprisonment, deportation, loss of employment, and organized violence.

The 272 registered participants represented 32 states, 3 countries, and several scholarly disciplines. The discussion highlighted the importance of preparing history-informed doctoral students to (1) conduct historical research that will advance and correct the existing historical record, (2) teach history to BSW and MSW students, and (3) advance social work practice that is historically informed. In response to strong requests from Social Welfare and Social Work doctoral students for the opportunity to discuss their interest in historical research with other students and faculty, the SWHG has planned the following first-ever meeting of Doctoral Students Interested In (“Making”) History. We welcome students interested in: Support for an existing historical dissertation research; Developing an initial historical dissertation research topic; Adding historical content to dissertation, class, assignment, publications; Teaching a social work history course; Pursuing historical knowledge foundational to the social work canon.

Drawing on lessons from our shared history, we will explore how social work has both perpetuated and responded to historical atrocities between the 1860s and today, with a particular focus on the ethical dilemmas that social workers have faced when decisions of conscience challenge the law and professional values. We will discuss the resistance efforts made by historically marginalized populations and the social work profession itself against inequality in pursuit of social and racial justice. By understanding the origins of the term "social work" and what it means to populations historically left out of dominant Eurocentric social work efforts, we can equip social work doctoral students with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate such complex ethical dilemmas in promoting a more civil, equitable, and just society. This keynote presentation is an important forum for purposeful dialogue on how we can draw on the lessons of social work history to prepare doctoral students for the challenges of today's divisive times.},

	abstract = {Background: Despite growing recognition of the importance of fathers in child abuse risk, the field of perinatal home visitation has only begun to consider fathers' roles in the implementation of such services. Objectives: This study examines the effectiveness of Dads Matter-HV (“DM-HV”), a father-inclusion enhancement to home visitation, and hypothesized mediators of impact. Methods: A multisite cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted with 17 home visiting program teams serving 204 families across study conditions. Program supervisors and their teams were randomized to deliver home visiting services plus DM-HV enhanced services (intervention) or home visiting services alone (control). Data were collected at three time points: baseline, 4 months post-baseline immediately following the intervention, and 12 months post-baseline. We employed structural equation modeling to estimate the effect of the intervention on physical child abuse risk and to trace hypothesized mediators, including the quality of the father-worker relationship, parents' partner support and abuse, and the timing of service initiation. Results: Results indicated that the DM-HV enhancement improved home visitor relationships with fathers, but only for families receiving services initiated postnatally. For these families, the improved quality of the father-worker relationship predicted improved parents' support of one another and reduced bidirectional mother-father partner abuse at 4-month follow-up, which in turn lowered maternal physical child abuse risk and paternal physical child abuse risk at 12month follow-up. Conclusions: DM-HV can strengthen the impact of home visitation services on physical child abuse risk for families when services are initiated postnatally.},

Using the actor–partner interdependence model, we examined fathers’ and mothers’ reciprocal influences on parenting stress, with a focus on interparental relationship and co-parenting. Data from 174 couple dyads from the Dads Matter-HV© program were analyzed. Findings showed that both mothers’ and fathers’ co-parenting directly reduced their own parenting stress. Fathers’ co-parenting significantly mediated the association between their own interparental relationship and parenting stress and the association between their own interparental relationship and mothers’ parenting stress. Findings suggest fathers’ perceptions of co-parenting are an important protective factor to be targeted by early child and family programs among parents at risk for chronic and parenting stress.},

	abstract = {Despite home visiting’s established legacy, the potential influence of intersecting parental characteristics on parent–worker relationships is less understood. This study examines the main and interaction effects of parents’ demographic characteristics on positive relationships with workers in home visiting and compares whether and how these effects differ between fathers and mothers. This study analyzed 130 mothers and 180 fathers who participated in home visiting services. Immigrant status was a significant predictor of positive worker relationships for mothers and fathers, whereas ethnicity was only significant for fathers. Interaction analyses indicated that U.S.-born Hispanic/Latinx fathers faced greater challenges in building positive worker relationships than their foreign-born counterparts. These findings highlight the importance of developing gender-specific and culturally responsive strategies to enhance parent–worker relationships.},

	abstract = {Long-lasting, supportive relationships (what we call “enduring relationships”) are important for youths’ transition to adulthood, but these relationships are often ruptured for young people in foster care. We investigate how common enduring relationships are among youth making the transition out of care and whether having an enduring relationship improves their outcomes in early adulthood. Our sample includes 608 youths in California foster care (𝑛=608) participating in the longitudinal CalYOUTH Study. We find that 48 percent of youth have an enduring relationship. Rates are particularly low for Black and Native American/Alaskan Native youth. Most enduring relationships have characteristics of strong ties—most are with family members and peers who provide multiple types of social support. Having an enduring relationship is found to have real, material consequences, reducing risks of food insecurity, economic hardships, and homelessness. This study amplifies the call for child welfare policy and practice to prioritize relational permanence.},

With over 1,000 individuals trained at the master’s and doctoral levels, the MFP has played a signicant role in preparing scholar-practitioners to make impactful contributions in addressing the needs of vulnerable populations. Through testimonios, we explore the career trajectory, collaborative partnerships, and community effect of a cluster of five doctoral-level MFP alums hired at a large public R1 university in the Southwest from 2016 to 2023. Our testimonios bear witness to our collective experiences as MFP alums and diverse faculty of color, particularly as they relate to our positionality before, during, and after our time as fellows. We examine the pivotal aspects of MFP participation, including its infuence on our engagement in antiracist, antioppressive, and decolonial initiatives and efforts to recruit and mentor graduate students of color. We close by sharing the enduring lessons and insights gained from the MFP and propose strategies for cultivating a diverse doctoral student pipeline in social work to address mental health and substance abuse issues.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the historical development of the Council on Social Work
Education’s (CSWE) Minority Fellowship Program (MFP), coinciding with the 50th anniversary
of its research fellowship. By leveraging archival CSWE materials like meeting minutes, reports,
letters, and newsletters, it chronicles key events from 1954 that culminated in the MFP’s creation
in 1973 and extends to the third research fellowship cohort in 1978, just before the introduction
of the second clinical fellowship. The paper details the challenges and milestones that shaped
early initiatives for diversity and inclusion within social work education. It offers a reflective
examination of the MFP’s inception, tracing the advocacy and structural changes within the
CSWE and broader social movements that culminated in the creation of the MFP and its
sustained impact on the profession. Established to address the underrepresentation of minorities
in social work education, the MFP was designed to develop researchers and practitioners of color
attuned and responsive to the varied needs of their communities. This paper not only enriches the
social work historical record but also highlights the transformative impact of the MFP in
cultivating a profession that truly reflects and effectively serves our racially and ethnically
diverse society.},

	abstract = {In the U.S. foster care system caseworkers are charged with preparing older adolescents unlikely to be reunified with their families or be adopted for independent adulthood. An important tool is the transitional independent living plan (TILP), which involves collaboratively engaging transition-age youth in planning for their future, identifying goals, and determining service needs. The TILP guides which Independent Living Services (ILS) the youth may receive. Depending on the youth’s goals and needs, ILS may include training and support in education, career, parenting, and other areas. Past research on this topic has focused on the availability and effectiveness of ILS and TILP planning. Less is known about whether the frequency of TILP engagement is associated with ILS use. Using administrative data and representative longitudinal survey data, we examine the relationship between TILP development and ILS utilization patterns among older youth in STATE foster care. Our results show that youth developed less than one TILP per year, used about one ILS monthly, and used four different types of ILS while in care. Our regression results demonstrate that youth with more TILP engagement were expected to use more ILS and a broader range of ILS. Our results also highlight associations between the county’s administrative contexts and the youths’ ILS utilization patterns. Our study offers rare empirical evidence that underscores the importance of regularly co-producing future plans with youth, training caseworkers to work collaboratively with youth in decisions about their lives, and reducing between-county variation in TILP and ILS practices.},

Purpose: As these disparities continue to widen, social workers fail to recognize the unique struggles of Indigenous children and families upon encountering the child welfare system. Design: The present work provides a historic overview of Indigenous child welfare interaction, grounds discussions in coloniality, and implicates social work’s complicity in perpetuating the genocidal fiscal economy of Native child trafficking. Results: Through a lens of Indigenous child welfare, we sift through the abolitionist/reformist debate, introduce the Indian Child Welfare Act as an example of a non- reformist reform, concluding with implications for social work practice.},
